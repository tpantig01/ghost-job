# Job Application Helper - Fight Against Ghost Jobs

### Introduction

Applying for jobs on platforms like LinkedIn can feel frustrating and inefficient. Often, you’re left in the dark, not knowing if you’ll ever get a callback. The process becomes even more painful when you discover job postings that lack transparency—listings without salaries, positions that are months old, or worse, jobs that have already been filled but are still visible.

To tackle this, we’ve developed a browser plugin that simplifies your job search experience. Our tool helps you assess whether a job is worth applying to by calculating a "ghost job" likelihood percentage, so you can see if it’s likely to be a legitimate opportunity or just a filler post.

Our mission with this repository is to create a foundation for a collaborative community. Here, contributors can share their own metrics for identifying ghost jobs, building a stronger framework together to discourage companies from posting misleading or outdated job listings. Together, we can make a difference.

**Together, We Win!**

### Implemented Metrics for Ghost Job Identification:

- **Mention of Salary in Job Posting** – A transparent salary range helps determine if a listing is credible.
- **Age of the Job Posting** – Older listings may indicate a filled position or a lack of urgency from the hiring company.
- **Reposted Frequency** – Tracks if the job has been reposted multiple times, which could signal an inactive or ghost listing.

### Future Plans

- **Extend the Extension to Different Browsers**
  - Support for Firefox
  - Support for Safari

- **Add New Ghost Job Identification Metrics**
  - Check if the job is available on the company’s official website.
  - Evaluate the company’s reputation and credibility.
  - Review the hiring history of the company.
  - Monitor recent layoffs within the company.
  - Collect employee reviews from platforms like Glassdoor.
